## 设计哲理 Design philosophy:

1. Easy: A well-designed language should be easy to learn (especially for zero-beginner).

2. Unambiguous meaning & pronunciation. Every word has only 1 way to pronounce it. Every sentence has only 1 meaning without ambiguity. This should make immediate sense. If a sentence has more than 1 meaning, it is called a buggy sentence which can be fixed by changing or enforcing words or the entire grammar rules.

3. Concise: Able to express a full complete meaning with short/brief sentence.  

4. Creative: Users can have fun in creating new words.  

5. Scientific: Users can collaborate scientific & mathematical idea or jargon into the language to encourage exploratory spirit of fellow science. This language could overcome limitation, ambiguities & bias from some natural languages including English, Chinese, Arabic etc. Academic scholars & scientists could use this language to communicate with each other.

###### Why don't use existing natural language or conlang eg: Esperanto & Ido instead of creating a new language from scratch?

- Every language has its own pros & cons, so we'd like to make good use of all the pros & get rid of the unnecessities.

###### Why did you allow people to copy & distribute your hard work here?

- We believe a language is meant to unify people via communication, instead of discrimination. If our project failed for whatever reasons (political, social, or simply misunderstanding), we hope that your projects may make it for us. You can simply fork it & create a new branch from our project.
